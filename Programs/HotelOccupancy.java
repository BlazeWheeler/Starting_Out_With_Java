 * Page: 263 Problem 7: Hotel Occupancy
 * 
 * @Description A hotelâ€™s occupancy rate is calculated as follows:
 * Occupancy rate 5 Number of rooms occupied 4 Total number of rooms
 * Write a program that calculates the occupancy rate for 
 * each floor of a hotel.A loop should then iterate once for 
 * each floor.During each iteration, the loop should ask the user
 * for the number of rooms on the floor and the number of them 
 * that are occupied.After all the iterations, the program should 
 * display the number of rooms the hotel has, the number of them 
 * that are occupied, the number that are vacant, and the occupancy
 * rate for the hotel. 
 * Input Validation: Do not accept a value less than 1 for the 
 * number of floors. Do not accept a number less than 10 for 
 * the number of rooms on a floor.
