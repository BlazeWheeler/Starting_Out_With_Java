 * @Description If you have downloaded this bookâ€™s source code 
 * (the companion Web site is available at www.pearsonhighered.com/gaddis),
 *  you will find a file named WorldSeriesWinners.txt. 
 * This file contains a chronological list of the winning teams in the World Series from 1903 through 2009. 
 * (The first line in the file is the name of the team that won in 1903,
 *  and the last line is the name of the team that won in 2009. 
 *  Note that the World Series was not played in 1904 or 1994, so those years are skipped in the file.)
 *  Write a program that lets the user enter the name of a team, and then displays the number of 
 *  times that team has won the World Series in the time period from 1903 through 2009.
