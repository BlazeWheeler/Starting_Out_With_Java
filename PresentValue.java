 * Book Title: From Control Structures through Objects by Tony Gaddis 
 * Page: 316 Problem 16: Present Value
 * 
 * @Description Suppose you want to deposit a certain amount of money 
 * into a savings account, and then leave it alone to draw interest 
 * for the next 10 years. At the end of 10 years, you would like to
 * have $10,000 in the account. How much do you need to deposit today
 * to make that happen? You can use the following formula, which is 
 * known as the present value formula, to find out:
 * 		   			    F
 * 				P = --------
 * 	   			    (1+r) *2
 * 
 * The terms in the formula are as follows:
 * P is the present value, or the amount that you need to deposit today.
 * F is the future value that you want in the account. (F is $10,000.)
 * r is the annual interest rate.
 * n is the number of years that you plan to let the money sit 
 * in the account.
 * Write a method named presentValue that performs this calculation. 
 * The method should accept the future value, annual interest rate, 
 * and number of years as arguments. It should return the present value,
 * which is the amount that you need to deposit today. Demonstrate the
 * method in a program that lets the user experiment with different 
 * values for the formulaâ€™s terms.
