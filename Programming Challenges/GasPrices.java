 * Book Title: From Control Structures through Objects by Tony Gaddis & GodFrey Muganda 
 * Page: 399 Problem 11: 1994 Gas Prices
 * 
 * @Description In the student sample for this book you will find a text file named 1994 weekly gas averages.txt. 
 * The file contains 52 lines of text that represent average weekly gas. 
 * Line one contains average price for week one and line 2 contains the average price for week 2 etc.
 * Write a program that reads the gas prices from the file into an array of an ArrayList. 
 * The program should do the following:
 * Display the lowest average price of the year, along with the week number for that price, and the name of the month which it occurred.
 * Display the highest average price of the year, along with the week number for that price, and the name of the month which it occurred.
 * Display the average gas price for each month.
 * Txt file gas averages. I'm just starting out with java. Whatever answer is provided, could you keep it simple enough for me to understand since Iâ€™m having difficulty.
